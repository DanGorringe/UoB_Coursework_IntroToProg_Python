This is Dan Gorringe's python project for EMAT10007 (https://www.bris.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/UnitDetails.jsa?ayrCode=23%2F24&unitCode=EMAT10007)

The main python is within the src directory.

To 'run' the 'game' use:
`python3 game.py`

Be warned that the game does generate images which it then places in `src/data/answers`

I also got so scared on the approach to the deadline that I started to create a different project as I got myself caught up on classes. This small plotting program can be found in `/backup` and can be run using:
`python3 plotGraphTerminal.py`
